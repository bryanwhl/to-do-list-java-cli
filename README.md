This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update IntelliJ to the most recent version.

### On IntelliJ version 2020.3.1 (latest) and beyond

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Import the project into IntelliJ as follows:
   1. Click `Open`
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Duke.Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the output below.

   ```
